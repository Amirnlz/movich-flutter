# movich-flutter

A Flutter project for getting to know which movie you would like to watch with various of lists.

**_combine (which + movie) => movich_**

The aim of this project is to provide flutter knowledge to get familiar with the flutter framework.
So the number of users that have been installed is not so important.

I would be grateful for any criticism or suggestion that makes the project move forward.
